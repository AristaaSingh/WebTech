  <h1> A Tale of Aroma: Coffee </h1>
  <p class = "description">
    Coffee is a popular beverage made from roasted coffee beans, known for its dark color, bitterness, and slight acidity, attributed to        its caffeine content. It holds the highest sales among hot drinks        globally. The process involves separating the seeds of the Coffea        plant's fruits to produce green coffee beans, which are then             roasted, ground, and steeped in hot water. The resulting brew can be     served hot   or cold and prepared in various methods such as             espresso, French press, or caffè latte. Sugar, sugar substitutes,        milk, and cream are often added to adjust the taste. <a href= '#cof1'> (1) </a>

  <h2> History of Coffee </h2>
  <p class= "description">
    The history of coffee is marked by its stimulating effect, which propelled its popularity despite being deemed intoxicating. Many even embraced coffee as an alternative to alcohol. Despite potential penalties, coffee consumption spread rapidly, giving rise to coffeehouses. Introduced to Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries, reactions varied from prohibition to acceptance. By the late 17th century, coffeehouses thrived across Britain, the American colonies, and Europe. Initially sourced mainly from Yemen, coffee cultivation expanded to Java, the Indonesian archipelago, and the Americas. Hawaii began coffee cultivation in 1825. By the 20th century, Brazil emerged as a major producer. Industrial processes like roasting, grinding, vacuum sealing, and decaffeination developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Instant coffee production surged after 1950, boosting Robusta bean cultivation in Africa. This historical trajectory underscores coffee's enduring impact on cultures and economies worldwide. <a href= '#cof2'> (2) </a>
