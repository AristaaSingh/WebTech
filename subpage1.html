  <h1> The Cappuccino </h1>
  <p class = "description">
    A cappuccino is an espresso-based coffee drink with steamed milk foam, traditionally smaller in volume than a latte but with a thicker layer of microfoam. It can be prepared with variations like using cream or non-dairy milk substitutes and flavored with cinnamon or cocoa powder. The name "cappuccino" originates from the Capuchin friars, referring to the color of their habits and the beverage's resemblance when milk is added to dark coffee. Its modern appearance, characterized by espresso créma and steamed milk, has evolved over time. <a href= '#cap1'> (1) </a>

  <h2> The Art of Preparing a Cappuccino </h2>
  <ol class= "steps">
  <li>
    First, steam the milk. Heat 1 cup of milk in a 2-quart saucepan over medium heat. Let the milk simmer until bubbles form around the edges, but don’t boil the milk. Remove the pan from heat and set it on a flat surface.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    Next, whip the milk with an electric mixer, increasing the speed as the milk begins to thicken. Continue mixing until you get the desired volume of froth.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    Now, make the coffee. Measure 2 tablespoons of grounds for 5 to 6 ounces of water. You can brew the coffee in an automatic drip coffeemaker or a French press.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    Now, make the cappuccino! A classic cappuccino calls for 1/3 espresso, 1/3 steamed milk, and 1/3 foam. You can mix it up by using 2 or 3 tablespoons of flavored syrups or even different kinds of milk, like chocolate or vanilla. <a href= '#cap2'> (2) </a>
