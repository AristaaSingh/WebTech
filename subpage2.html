  <h1> The Caffe Mocha </h1>
  <p class = "description">
    A caffè mocha, also known as mocaccino or mochachino, is a chocolate-flavored warm beverage resembling a caffè latte, often served in a glass rather than a mug. Its name originates from the Yemeni port of Mokha, renowned for coffee trade in the 15th to 17th centuries. Despite the rarity of pure Yemeni coffee, European importers labeled Arabian coffee as "Mochas." The modern mocha incorporates chocolate, perhaps influenced by the chocolatey tones found in Yemeni coffee. Chocolate and coffee were combined in 17th-century Italy, leading to the evolution of drinks like bavareisa and bicerin. Before the 1900s, "Mocha" referred solely to Yemeni coffee, but its meaning gradually shifted. Recipes featuring chocolate and coffee, reminiscent of mocha, emerged in the early 20th century, including a recipe for "Chilled Mocha" published in 1920. <a href= '#moc1'> (1) </a>

  <h2> The Art of Preparing a Caffe Mocha </h2>
  <ol class= "steps">
  <li>
    Make approximately 35ml of espresso using a coffee machine and pour it into the base of your cup. Add drinking chocolate to the espresso and mix until smooth.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    Steam the milk using the steamer attachment until it has around 4-6cm of foam on top.Hold the milk jug so that the spout is about 3-4cm above the cup. 
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    Pour the steamed milk into the cup steadily, aiming into the center as the volume increases.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    Bring the milk jug closer to the surface of the coffee as you pour. Tilt the milk jug slightly to accelerate the pour, allowing the milk to create a pattern on the top of the drink as it folds naturally. <a href= '#moc2'> (2) </a>
