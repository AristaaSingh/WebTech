  <h1> The Espresso </h1>
  <p class = "description">
    Espresso is a coffee-brewing method originating from Italy, with significant contributions from French inventions leading to today's espresso machines. It involves forcing nearly boiling water under pressure through finely ground coffee beans. Espresso is highly popular globally and can be made with various coffee beans and roasting degrees. It's distinguished by its thickness, similar to warm honey, and the creamy foam called crema that forms on top. The pressurized brewing process concentrates flavors and chemicals, resulting in a potent cup of coffee. The crema, a dense foam layer, is unique to espresso due to emulsified oils and dissolved carbon dioxide. Espresso is enjoyed on its own and serves as the base for numerous other coffee drinks like caffè latte, cappuccino, caffè macchiato, mocha, flat white, and caffè americano. <a href= '#esp1'> (1) </a>

  <h2> The Art of Preparing an Espresso </h2>
  <ol class= "steps">
  <li>
    Use the finest setting on your grinder with espresso or dark roast beans. Grind enough beans for one or two shots. For a single shot, you'll need about 9-10g of whole bean coffee.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    Evenly distribute grounds in the filter and tamp down firmly to create a compact espresso disk.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    Purge the machine by briefly running it without the portafilter. Lock the portafilter, position your demitasse glass underneath, and start the shot. Espresso should be ready in 25-30 seconds, with a caramel-colored crema on top. <a href= '#esp2'> (2) </a>
