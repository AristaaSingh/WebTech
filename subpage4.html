  <h1> The Caffe Americano </h1>
  <p class = "description">
    Caffè Americano, also known simply as americano, is a coffee drink made by diluting an espresso shot with hot water at a ratio of 1:3 to 1:4. This method preserves the nuanced flavors of espresso in a lighter form, with its strength varying based on the number of espresso shots and the quantity of water added. In Italy, caffè americano may refer to either diluted espresso or long-filtered coffee, the latter being more accurately termed caffè all'americana. The term "Americano" means "American" in Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese. Its origins are debated, with some suggesting it entered English from Italian in the 1970s, while others associate it with World War II G.I.s in Italy diluting espresso with hot water. However, the Oxford English Dictionary traces it back to Central American Spanish as a term for mild coffee in the 1950s, with its English usage appearing in 1964. The term caffè americano was adopted into Italian later, possibly from English or Spanish sources. <a href= '#cam1'> (1) </a>

  <h2> The Art of Preparing a Caffe Americano </h2>
  <ol class= "steps">
  <li>
    A 1-shot Americano can mostly fit in an espresso mug (shown here). A 2-shot drink is best suited in a latte mug.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    Make the espresso. Use espresso roast coffee to make espresso using your favorite method: with an automated espresso machine, manual espresso maker.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    Boil the water. Use a regular or electric teapot to boil the water. The standard ratio is 2:1 water to espresso, but you can go up to as much as 3:1.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    Mix the two and enjoy! Pour the boiling water into the espresso. Instant Caffe Americano! <a href= '#cam2'> (2) </a>
